9:00 pm- Late start to the project. I am trying to develop a very short but engaging experience. I lack strong coding skills but I am beginning to understand code language and logic better lately. Doing this solo is an ardous task but I have committed and wish to simply try to deliver something, anything within the given time frame. i should serve as good practice for tight deadlines that are often the staple in our industry. I started off by weighing how I could bring a miniature visual treat by weaving in light narrative and fun yet looping gameplay. After some initial playing around with basic ideas that could I use for Gamemaker sutdio, I zeroed in on a bullet hell game. The game is to be top-down with octa directional movement. This taskes away from needing to manage pesky pesky grav physics. Quirky visuals to elevate simple gameplay is the name of the game. After some initial brainstorming, the idea I have landed with is as follows.
### Narrative
A hand gets his fingers stolen and is left with one. It fights hand- themed enemies to retrieve his fingers by defeating them all. Still unsure about the arena management. I could make it an infinite arena with camera tracked tilesets spawning/ despawning or a closed off map with predetermined enemy placements across the map. I am initially going to try and do the infnite spawn thing. If I cannot implement the required logic, I shall revert to the basic idea of preset maps.

8:00 am- I have begun creating the basic player character, one spawner character and environnment tiles to set the scene up and test out the enemy spawn logic and resulting feel of gameplay. I shall upload the first build here to keep track of my progress. i also have to give a lot of time to art for the primary gameplay feel, so I should hurry up and create simple enemy types that are easy to implement.
